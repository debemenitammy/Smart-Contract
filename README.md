# Smart-Contract
A smart contract built with hardhat and deployed on the testnet network (Rinkeby)

This repository contains a contract that does the following:
- Creates an event that stores the arguments passed into the transaction
- Creates a public state variable "message".
- Creates a constructor that initializes the public state variable of the contract.
- Creates a function that stores the public state variable temporarily to memory and triggers an event to update the message to a new message.
